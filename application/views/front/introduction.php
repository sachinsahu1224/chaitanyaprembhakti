<p>as the most effective means of self-purification in this kaliyug.</p>



<p>Shrimad Bhagavad Gita and Shri Bhagwat Purana, are the prime scriptures followed by Gaudiya Vaishnavas.</p>



<p>The First ever Preaching centre was formed on 6 September 1920 by Shri Shrimad Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami “Prabhupāda” which was named as “Gaudiya math”.</p>

<p>“Prabhupāda” appeared in Shri Kshetra Dham.(Jagannatha Puri) on 6 February 1874 as the son of Shrila Sachchidananda Bhaktivinoda Thakkura. He preached convincingly against casteism and philosophical deviations from Gaudiya Vaisnavism .</p>

<p>He preached Shri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s message of Divine Love widely throughout India with great vigour. Following Srila Thakura Bhaktivinoda's principles, he opposed varnashrama to harmonize society and provide spiritual fulfillment for all.</p>



<p>He established Gaudiya Math in Mayapur, West Bengal which later recognised as the parent body of all Gaudiya Math branches. It soon developed into a dynamic missionary with sixty-four branches across India .The mission was further propogated by his disciples in several parts of the country.</p>



<p>Before entering into ‘nitya lila’, Shrila Bhaktisiddhānta Saraswatī Goswami “Prabhupāda” appointed his dearmost disciple “Shri Shrimad Bhakti Dayit Madhav Goswami ji Maharaj” as his successor.</p>



<p>Srila Bhakti Dayita Madhav Goswami Maharaj appeared in this world on November 18, 1904 A.D. (on Holy Utthan Ekadashi tithi) at Kanchanpara.</p>



<p>He accepted the renounced order of His Gurudev Shrila ‘Prabhupada’ and started preaching. He established many large preaching centers in various parts of India. One of his most significant contributions was to re-establish the appearance site of His Pujya Gurudev “ Shrila Prabhupāda” in Śhrī Jagannātha Puri. Also He was known to be the founder of All India Shri Chaitanya Gaudiya Math in Kolkata in 1953. Presently, ‘Tridandi Swami Shri Bhakti Vallabh Tirtha Goswami Ji Maharaj’ is the president of All India Shri Chaitanya Gaudiya Math.</p>



<p>Before his disappearance in 1979, Shri Shrimad Bhakti Dayit Madhav Goswami ji Maharaj asked his disciples to further propogate the mission all together .</p>



<p>Following the orders of his spiritual master, his disciple, Shri Shri 108 Shri Vasudev Sharan “Virahi” Ji Mahraj extended the mission & started preaching in northwest and central regions of the country.</p>



<p>Later he established a body named “Shri Krishna Chaitanya Prem Bhakti Sangh” which encompasses spiritual practices completely based on the teachings attributed to Lord Chaitanya.</p>
